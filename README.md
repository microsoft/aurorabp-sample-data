# The Aurora-BP Study and Dataset

This repository contains sample code, sample data, and explanatory information for working with the **Aurora-BP dataset** released alongside the publication of the [**Aurora-BP study**](#citation).

The dataset includes de-identified participant information, raw sensor data aligned with each measurement, and a wide variety of features derived from sensor data. The publishing of this dataset as well as the characterization of multiple feature groups across a broad population and multiple settings are intended to aid future cardiovascular research.

Note that the data contained in this repository represent a very small sample of the full dataset, meant only to illustrate the structure of the files and allow testing with the sample code. For access to the full dataset, see the [data access](#data-access) section below.

## Citation

If you use this repository, part or all of the full dataset, and/or our paper as part of your research, please refer to the dataset as the **Aurora-BP dataset** and cite the publication as follows:
